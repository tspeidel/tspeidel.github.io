### Where Are We Now?
We now find ourselves at the intersection of four significant developments: first, the <u>prominent influence of technology firms</u>, which sometimes overshadow other important aspects of the field. Second, the <u>complex relationship between business and science</u> with its high failure rate. Third, the <u>democratization of data science</u>, which has introduced many practitioners with limited background in scientific research. Fourth, the <u>advent of generative AI</u>, where models are predominantly pre-trained due to their complexity and cost, has led to the deployment of generative AI being more akin to data plumbing.
